# NHAI_FOB_Data_Analysis
NHAI FOB Analysis is a data-driven project analyzing the condition, complaints, and requests related to Foot Over Bridges (FOBs) using SQL and Power BI. It provides insights into maintenance trends, safety issues, and complaint resolutions to improve infrastructure planning and public safety.

Project Overview
The NHAI FOB Analysis project focuses on analyzing the condition, complaints, and public requests related to Foot Over Bridges (FOBs) in India. Using SQL for data processing and Power BI for interactive visualization, this project provides insights to improve FOB placement, maintenance, and pedestrian safety.

📌 Why This Project?
FOBs play a crucial role in pedestrian safety, but several issues—poor maintenance, inconvenient locations, and lack of accessibility—reduce their effectiveness. This analysis helps:
✔️ Identify high-risk FOBs needing urgent repairs.
✔️ Analyze public complaints & requests for infrastructure improvement.
✔️ Provide data-driven insights for better planning & decision-making.

📊 Data & Analysis
🔍 SQL Data Processing (FOB_condition,Complains&Requests_data_analysis.sql)
The SQL queries in this project help clean, filter, and extract key insights from FOB-related data. Key analyses include:

✅ Incidents Analysis: Identifies common reasons why people avoid using FOBs.
✅ Distance Issue Detection: Finds locations where FOBs are too far from pedestrian crossings.
✅ Complaint Trends: Tracks which locations have the highest number of complaints.
✅ Survey Feedback Analysis: Examines public ratings (1-5) to understand satisfaction levels.
✅ Most Requested FOB Locations: Identifies where new FOBs are most needed based on public demand.

📈 Power BI Dashboard (NHAI FOB ANALYSIS dashboard.pbix)
The Power BI dashboard visually represents the findings, making it easier to interpret trends and take action.

📌 Key Features
📍 Complaint Heatmap: Shows which areas have the highest number of issues.
📍 Maintenance Trend Graphs: Displays patterns in FOB repairs and upgrades.
📍 Survey Feedback Chart: Highlights public satisfaction levels.
